# ðŸ”’ HTTPS Security Fix

## Problem
Browser warning: **"The information you're about to submit is not secure"**

This happened because forms were submitting over HTTP instead of HTTPS, even though Koyeb provides HTTPS.

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. âœ… Force HTTPS in Production
**File**: `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\URL;

public function boot(): void
{
    // Force HTTPS in production
    if (config('app.env') === 'production') {
        URL::forceScheme('https');
    }
}
```

**What it does**: Forces all URLs generated by Laravel to use `https://` instead of `http://`

---

### 2. âœ… Trust Koyeb Proxies
**File**: `app/Http/Middleware/TrustProxies.php`

```php
protected $proxies = '*'; // Trust all proxies
```

**What it does**: Allows Laravel to correctly detect HTTPS connection behind Koyeb's reverse proxy

## Deployment Status

âœ… **Changes Committed**: Commit `1b08936`  
âœ… **Pushed to GitHub**: main branch  
ðŸ”„ **Koyeb Auto-Deploy**: In progress (2-3 minutes)

---

## Verification Steps

### After deployment completes (~3 minutes):

1. **Visit your site**: https://your-app-name.koyeb.app/

2. **Check the search form**:
   - Enter a matricule (e.g., `MAT001`)
   - Click search
   - âœ… **No warning should appear**

3. **Verify HTTPS**:
   - Look for ðŸ”’ padlock in browser address bar
   - All forms should submit securely
   - No mixed content warnings

4. **Test all forms**:
   - Login form: `/connexion`
   - Registration: `/inscription`
   - Transcript search: `/` (homepage)
   - All should submit over HTTPS

---

## Why This Happened

Koyeb provides HTTPS automatically, but Laravel didn't know it was behind a proxy. When Laravel generated form URLs, it used `http://` because:

1. The request to Laravel came from Koyeb's proxy (HTTP internally)
2. Laravel didn't trust the proxy's `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` header
3. URLs were generated as `http://` instead of `https://`

**Solution**: Force HTTPS + Trust proxies = All URLs use `https://`

---

## Current Configuration

```env
APP_ENV=production
APP_URL=https://your-app-name.koyeb.app
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
TRUSTED_PROXIES=*
```

---

## Additional Security Features Now Active

âœ… **Secure Cookies**: Only sent over HTTPS  
âœ… **SameSite Protection**: Prevents CSRF attacks  
âœ… **HTTPS URLs**: All generated URLs use https://  
âœ… **Proxy Detection**: Correctly detects HTTPS behind proxy

## Monitor Deployment

Check Koyeb deployment status:
```
https://app.koyeb.com/apps/your-app-name/deployments
```

Watch logs:
```
Koyeb Dashboard â†’ Your App â†’ Logs â†’ Live tail
```

Look for:
```
âœ… Laravel application is ready!
âœ… Apache resuming normal operations
```

---

## If You Still See the Warning

### Clear your browser cache:
- **Chrome**: Ctrl+Shift+Delete â†’ Clear cached images and files
- **Firefox**: Ctrl+Shift+Delete â†’ Clear cache
- **Safari**: Cmd+Option+E

### Force refresh:
- **Windows**: Ctrl+F5
- **Mac**: Cmd+Shift+R

### Check APP_ENV in Koyeb:
```
Koyeb â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
APP_ENV should be: production (not local or development)
```
